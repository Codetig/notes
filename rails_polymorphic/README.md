# Polymorphic Associations

What is polymorphism in programming?

How does this apply to the world of Rails?

What if you wanted to create associations, for example a `belongs_to`-`has_many` association, or a `belongs_to`-`has_one` association, such that *multiple entities* in your schema may be associated with the *same single* entity type? How would you do it?

## Examples of the concept in the wild:

* Think about how Facebook implements `Comments` on `Photos`, `Videos`, `Notes`, etc. The `Comments` work in the same exact way across all of those different entities. 

* How there are `Photos` of `Users`, photos of `Places`, etc. In that case, it doesnâ€™t matter that they are photos of users or photos of places - photos are photos are photos.

With [Polymorphic Associations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations) this is possible and awesome!
